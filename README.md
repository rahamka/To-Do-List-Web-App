About : 
ðŸ’»âœ¨Just built my own To-Do-List App. Created Simple To-Do-List App using 3 Pillers of Web Development This month, I was learning more about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I created a small projects for practice. Itâ€™s a Task Manager app where I can:

â†’ Add tasks by typing and pressing Enter â†’ See them inside a clean UI â†’ Delete tasks when they are done I styled it to look simple & i make it more clean with time, added a dark theme, smooth hover effects, and a scrollable task list. This project may look simple, but it helped me understand: âœ” DOM manipulation in JavaScript âœ” Event listeners âœ” Dynamic element creation âœ” Styling a real-world UI Contra: https://lnkd.in/e2wq3t2d Upwork: https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~011a51d1d9fcb3f131?mp_source=share I believe small projects like this are a great way to learn JavaScript Logic but i hope in the next time i'll improve . ðŸš€ Iâ€™m excited to keep building more projects as I continue my journey toward becoming a Frontend Developer.
